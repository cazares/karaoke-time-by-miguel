Ricky\N\Nby\N\NJohn Frusciante
I was afraid to be me
Be anyone you want to be
Be anyone you want to be
I don't blame my weak
For my not being able to speak
Clearly about things I've said before
And if it's light outside\N\NNight will fall
Night will fall
And if it's life, it resolves
It resolves
Anywhere you are in a maze is a lie
Anywhere you are on a page\N\NYou still go to the right
Anytime there's no ground below you\N\NYou're in the sky
Anytime you're afraid\N\NIt's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
I was a flame in the night
I heard what I wanted to hear
And the moment I disappeared
I grew the size of all outside
'Cause I became one with the night
I became one with the night
And if it's real\N\Nit's not all
It's not all there is
There's a lot\N\NIn what appears not\N\NTo be there at all
And you can't function as\N\Nsomeone besides who you are
And you can't function\N\Nas someone besides who you are
And you can't function as someone\N\Nbesides who you are
And you can't function as someone besides
Who you are
