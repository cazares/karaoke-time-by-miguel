The Past Recedes\N\Nby\N\NJohn Frusciante
[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
And then the past recedes
And I won't be involved
The effort to be free
Seems pointless from above
You're looking down at me
I'd rather stay below
Than have you staring up at me
Is nowhere I want to go

[Chorus 1]
Ay, this business of how long we try to stay alive
Why, to be here, you first got to die, so I gave it a try
And what do you know? Time was so long ago

[Verse 2]
And things come back you see
To where they don't belong
And every drop of sea
Is the whole ocean

[Chorus 2]
I lied to the greatest thieves about anything and everything
I'm a figure of forgotten speech, I'm out of reach
Oh, I can't play it safe, but I might just in case

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
I'm disguised as a reaching hand
I'm a working man
I don't understand why clock-out
Comes so slow every time
That's one line I stay right behind
That's one line I stay right behind
Yeah

[Instrumental Outro]
