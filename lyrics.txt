[Intro]\N\NGuitar:John Frusciante\NDrums: Chad Smith\N\NVocals and Bass: YOU!
[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China\Ntry to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden\Ndream of silver screen quotation
And if you want\Nthese kind of dreams\Nit's Californication

[Verse 2]
It's the\Nedge of the world\Nand all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East\Nat least it settled in a final location
It's understood\Nthat Hollywood\Nsells Californication

[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well\Nto break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin\Nor is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn\NHardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication\NDream of Californication




[Verse 3]
Marry me, girl\Nbe my fairy to the world\Nbe my very own constellation
A teenage bride\Nwith a baby inside\Ngetting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard\Nit's Californication






[Verse 4]
Space may be the final frontier\Nbut it's made in a Hollywood basement

And Cobain, can you hear the spheres\Nsinging songs off Station To Station?

And Alderaan's not far away\Nit's Californication

[Pre-Chorus]
Born and raised\Nby those who praise\Ncontrol of population

Well, everybody's been there\Nand I don't mean on vacation

First born unicorn\NHardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication\NDream of Californication

Dream of Californication\NDream of Californication

[Guitar and (YOU on) Bass Solo]

[Verse 5]
Destruction leads to a very rough road\Nbut it also breeds creation

And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar\Nthey're just another good vibration

And tidal waves\Ncouldn't save the world\Nfrom Californication

[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well\Nto break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest\Nthere is no test\Nbut this is what you're craving
First born unicorn\NHardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication\NDream of Californication

Dream of Californication\NDream of Californication
