Californication\N\Nby\N\NRed Hot Chili Peppers
[Intro]
Guitar: John Frusciante\N\NDrums: Chad Smith\N\NVocals: YOU\N\NBass: ALSO YOU!
[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China\N\NTry to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden\N\NDream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams\N\NIt's Californication
[Verse 2]
It's the
Edge of the world\N\NAnd all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east\N\NAt least it settled in a final location
It's understood that\N\NHollywood sells Californication
[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well\N\NTo break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin?\N\NOr is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn\N\N\NHardcore soft porn
[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication..
[Verse 3]
Marry me girl\N\NBe my fairy to the world\N\NBe my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside\N\NGetting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard\N\NIt's Californication
[Verse 4]
Space may be the final frontier\N\NBut it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres\N\NSinging songs off station To station?
And Alderaan's not far away\N\NIt's Californication
[Pre-Chorus]
Born and raised by those who praise\N\NControl of population
Well, everybody's been there\N\NAnd I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn\N\NHardcore soft porn
[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication...
[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]\N\N[Bass Solo: person who stopped singing]
[Verse 5]
Destruction leads to a very rough road\N\NBut it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar\N\NThey're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world\N\NFrom Californication
[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well\N\NTo break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest\N\NThere is no test\N\NBut this is what you're craving
First born unicorn\N\NHardcore soft porn
[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication....
