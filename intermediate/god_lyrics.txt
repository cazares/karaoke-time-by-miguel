God\N\Nby\N\NJohn Frusciante
So each day would be new
I built you to sleep
That's the idea of dying
But you'll just have to see
You can do what you want
Or so you think
But 'til you stop all your thoughts
You are tied to your surroundings
When the fog spreads out\N\NIn the rainy season
It comes from my insides
When the thunderous lightning\N\NStrikes down
You're seeing your real I
People\N\N(People)
You blaspheme my name
But still I love you\N\NStill I love you
I love you just the same
I hear all your prayers\N\NBecause I'm each one of you
Creation's not something I did\N\NIt's something that I DO
The reason for the bad is\N\NSo there'd be such thing as good
Oh I'd do anything for you\N\NYou all know I would
Be for me\NBe for me\NBe for me
Before me\NBefore me\NBefore me
You know that I try to repair and repay
As life goes by a thousand times\N\NIt gets a little better
All is belief\N\NAll is belief\N\NAll is belief\N\NAll is belief
