[A Firm Kick by John Frusciante]\N\NA firm kick in the pants
This last chance to get things right
This was one time I closed an eye
Looked away from you
Look out for yourself tonight
Sometimes I have to get things right
I never meant what I said to you
Give up all the things that you love to do
I'd never guessed that you'd do me wrong
I'll never accept that dance and song
A little time to adjust would be just
What we need
I've meant to tell you what I think, that you think
When I cross your mind
Forgone, stressed at the light
What's wrong with bein' uptight
I never say what I intend to
But does it mean that much to you?
I'd a close call with a glitch in time
Are you really that happy to be mine?
No I'm not disguisin' all that fighting
And dreams not coming true
I will play some light from the sun
The world by my side
And I will see dawn as a forlorn
Maiden in the sky
And I will play a song of thunder
You may recognize
You make a never that's forever
Knowing what you deny
When I revisit the past, it's a blast
I've just gotta move on
I've just let down someone I relied on
And I don't see why
How'd we pretty up that speech
MC talking through me
I've never done what I've set out to do
Don't come to me 'cause I'll run from you
Left out of life, would I really care?
Not a whole lot, there's nothing for me there
I'll never forget the limits that we set
Back when it was our moon
I never made a pretense of living with good sense
It's really not my strong suit
